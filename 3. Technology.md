1. AWS Management Console.
2. Software Development Kit (SDK)
3. Command Line Interface (CLI)
4. AWS Cloudshell

---

### AWS Cloud Deployment Models

Cloud | On-Premises | Hybrid
--- | --- | ---
Public | Private | _
Infrastructure available to general public on the internet | Infrastructure solely for one organization | Comprised of two or more clouds(private, cloud)  
Owned by an organization selling cloud services | May be outsources or owned, on-premises or off-premises | Bound together to enable data and application portability

#### Ways to connect cloud to an on-premises data center
SIte-to-Site VPN
AWS Direct Connect

---

### Availabilty Zone 

A single data center or group of data centers within a region, each with redundant power, networking and connectivity, housed in separate facilities.

### Edge Location

A site that Amazon CloudFront uses to store cached copies of your content closer to your customers for faster delivery.

---

### AWS Technology Concepts

#### Ways to work with AWS
	- AWS Management Console (browser)
	- Programmatic access
		- From your local machine - both require access key IDs and secrets
			- Software Devloper Kit (SDK)
			- Command Line Interface (CLI)
		- AWS CloudShell
			- Browser-based; doesn't require access key ID.

#### Deployment Models
	- Public Cloud
	- On-premises
	- Hybrid (Connectivity: Site-to-Site VPN (over public internet) or Direct Connect (dedicated physical connection))

*Regions > Availability Zones > Edge Locations*

## Technologies

### Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
A virtual server that you rent in **AWS**
Called an **Instance**
Easy to scale - Reliable - use with other services - Only pay for what you use


#### Shared Responsibility Model for EC2

AWS Respnsibility | Customer (Your) Responsibility
--- | ---
Physical hardware and network | Software running on the instance, including operating system and applications (maintenance, patching, etc..)
Hypervisors (*Allow you to create virtual machines*) | Security groups and network access control lists
Elastic Block Store (EBS) storage system | Network architecture within the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)


#### EC2 Launch Types/Purchasing Options

Type | Description
--- | ---
On-Demand Instances |  Default option, Pay by the second while instance is running (minimum 60 seconds)
Reserved Instances | Reserve instances for 1-3 years (ex: database server), Savings up to 70%
Spot Instances | Bid on unused EC2 capacity, savings up to 90%, but can lose instance at any time
Dedicated Hosts | Book an entire physical server and bring your own licenses, Can be purchased on-demand or reserved
Dedicated Instances | Ensures no other AWS customer shares your hardware, Pay by the hour
Capacity Reservations | Reserve capacity for instances in a specific availability zone for any duration

#### Secure Shell (SSH)

Protocol used to securely log into other computers and run commands from the command line, Uses TCP protocol on Port 22

---

### Elastic Load Balancer

#### Benefits of Using Elastic Load Balancing

Managed Service

	 - AWS guarantees uptime
	 - AWS hanfles maintenance, upgrades, etc.

- Distributes the load across multiple instances, and across availability zones.
- Can handle instance failures by doing regular health checks
- Only exposes a single endpoint (DNS) to your application.

Type | Description
--- | ---
Application Load Balancer (ALB) |  Handles HTTP/HTTPS traffic, Layer 7.
Network Load Balancer | Handles TCP-UDP-TLS, Ultra-high performance, ultra-low latencies.
Gateway Load Balancer | Used to deploy and manage third-party virtual appliances usch as firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems
Classic Load Balancer | Previous genertion load balancer for use with the EC2-Classic network

---

### Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)

- Automatically scale out/in instances based on the load

	- Specify instance numbers: desired capacity, minimum and maximum.
	- Registers new instances with the load balancer

- Replace unhealthy instances automatically
- Run at optimal capacity, meaning cost savings 

--- 

### AWS Elastic Beanstalk (Magic trick for developer to avoid headache)

- #### Platform as a Service ( #PaaS).

	1. Infrastructure is handled for you
		- EC2 instances, load balancers, auto-scaling groups, database, etc...
	2. Uses CloudFormation templates to deploy the infrastructure.

- #### Health monitoring available in the Console

- #### Support for many platforms
	- Node, PHP, Java, Python, Go, .NET, Ruby, Docker, etc...


---

###  AWS Batch
Managed service for running batch jobs
	- Deep learning, big data, media encoding, image processing, email daily reports, etc..

You create the batch jobs (scripts, business logic)
	- Defined as Docker images

AWS handles everything else (instances, scheduler, queues, retries, etc...)
	- Processing at scale, optimized for the work load

---

### AWS Lightsail

**AWS** ***lite***

	- Meant for people with little to no cloud experience

- Good for simple applications and websites

- Pricing

	- Predictable
	- Less expensive

---

### Amazon WorkSpaces

- Desktops in the cloud

	- Employees and contractors can easily access applications and desktops from anywhere.

- Windows and Linux operating systems, with common app bundles (LibreOffice, Microsoft Office, browsers, antivirus, etc...)

- Replaces on premises Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI)

---

### AWS Lambda

~~Serverless computing~~
It's a code that runs on a server you don't have to buy or manage, in response to some event.
Can also be though of as *"Scripts"* or *"Functions"*

	- Single purpose
	- Right-sized
	- Easy to scale (up AND down)


#### Shared Responsibility Model for Lambda

AWS Responsibility | Customer (Your) Responsibility
--- | ---
Underlying infrastructure | Security of your code
Operating systems | Storage and access of data
Application platform | Identity and access management

---

### Docker

- Underlying container technology used in AWS.

- Docker images are read-only templates/blueprints used to create Docker containers.

	1. Created only once
	2. Stored in Docker repositories

- Docker containers are running instance of an image.

	1. Create multiple containers from the same image.

---
### There are Multiple Container Services

#### 1. Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)

- Used to run, stop and manage Docker containers in AWS.

- Integrated with many AWS services, including **IAM**, load balancers, auto scaling, **VPC**, etc...

- Created by AWS.

---

#### 2. Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)

- **Kubernetes as a service** on AWS

	1.  Kubernetes is an open source container orchestration platform.
	2. Automates deploying, scaling, management and scheduling of containers.
	3. Originally built by Google.
	4. Has large community and support.

- AWS installs, operates, and maintains the Kubernetes cluster/nodes.

---

#### Two Options for Running ECS/EKS

EC2 instances | Fargate
--- | ---
You provision and maintain the EC2 instaces that the containers run on | Serveless solution, AWS handles the underlying infrastructure.

---

#### 3. Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)

1. Private Repository on AWS for Docker images.

2. ECS, EKS pull images from here to build containers.

---

## Storage

---

### Simple Storage Service (S3)

- Inexpensive object (think *file*) storage in AWS.

=======

---

### S3 Transfer Acceleration
- Speeds up content transfers by as much as 50-500% for larger objects.
- Routes traffic through CloudFront edge locations.
- Enabled at the bucket level.

---

### Elastic Block Store (EBS)

---

#### Storage for an EC2 instance

- Think of this as a virtual hard drive
	- Attached over the network (not physically)

- Root Volume created for an EC2 instance; can add additional volumes as needed.

- A volume can only be attached to one instance at a time.

- Must be in the same availability zone as the instance.

#### Default persistence settings

- Persists when an instance is shut down.

- Deletes when an instance is terminated.

#### Can create a snapshot of a volume and then restore it

- Stored in **S3**.

- Useful for backup/recovery or copying to another availability region.

---

### Elastic File System (EFS)

1. Storage for an EC2 instances, containers, lambda functions, on-premises servers.

	- Can be used by Multiple things at a time
	- Can be used across Multiple availability

---

### Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

Your own private cloud/network within the cloud Isolates your resources from everyone else's.

Note: if you get a question about private subnet and limited access = **NAT Gateway**.

#### VPC Endpoints

it is adding a extra point of security by allowing you to keep all the traffic with a private network within AWS so you don't have to go across the public internet.

#### VPC Endpoints Types

| **Gateway**                               | **Interface**                              |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Used to connect to some AWS services :S3, DynamoDB | Used to connect to all others AWS services |

|:-----------------------------------------------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------:|
| firewall that controls traffic in/out of a **subnet** | Firewall that controls traffic in/out of an **EC2 instance** |
|           Rules for **Allow** and **Deny**            |                  Rules for **Allow** (only)                  |
|           Rules include IP addresses (only)           |     Rules include IP addresses and other security groups     |

---

### VPC Flow Logs

For Monitoring and troubleshooting purposes it helps you log all the activity on network.

Note: if you get a question about needing visibility into your network traffic the **VPC Flow Logs** is your answer.

---

### VPC Peering

- Peer VPC A with VPC B
	- Behave as a single network

- Caveats
	- VPCs can't have overlapping CIDR ranges (it wiil cause addresses conflict).
	- Not transitive (each VPC must  directly link to the other).

---

### Amazon API Gateway

- Supports monitoring, authentication, security, throttling ad more.

---

### Amazon CloudFront

- Content Delivery Network (**CDN**)
	- Geographically distributed.

|:-------------------------------------------------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Uses AWS's global Network and edge locations to improve speed |                  Use AWS's global network and edge location to improve speeds                   |
|         Content delivery network (e.g. , media files)         |                    Works for a wide variety of applications (HTTP, TCP, UDP)                    |
|           Serves cashed content from edge locations           | No caching; improvement comes from network routing of traffic 9(moving off the public internet) |
