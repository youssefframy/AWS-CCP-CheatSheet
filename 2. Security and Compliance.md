### AWS Shared Responsibility Model :

![Chart-1024x603-1.png (1024Ã—603) (sonraisecurity.com)](https://sonraisecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/Chart-1024x603-1.png)


1. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** : AWS will manage the bottom 4 layers and you are responsible on anything on top of that.

2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS)** : AWS will manage a few more things including the Runtime, Middleware and Operating System and you manage the applications and data.

3. **Software as a Service (SaaS)** : AWS is responsible for everything, you just need to use the software.

### What is Identity and Access Management (IAM) ?
Service that used o securly control access to your AWS resources. It controls **Authentication** (*Who*) and **Authorization** (*What they can do*).

### You should Know go to Lab6 in introduction 101 labs which is the introduction to AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).

### 1. Users

Root User | IAM User
--- | ---
One per account | Multiple per account
Unrestricted access | Users can be deleted or disabled
Difficult to restrict or revoke access | Easy to restrict access

#### A root user can perform the following tasks:

	- Close an AWS Account
	- Change an AWS support plan
	- Change AWS Account settings

*Note: For best practices always work in your IAM account not the root account, Set up IAM users with the least number of permissions needed.*

### 2. User Groups
Is a group of users that share the same roles and policies.

### 3. Role 

	- Similar to a user (an identity with permissions).
	- Does not have credentials (passwords or keys).
	- Assumable, temporarily, by anyone who needs it.

*Whatever hat you put on or whatever hat you put on as long as you are wearing this hat you can do the specific tasks with the role.*

### 4. Policies (Who can do what to which resources and when)
*Ex: Allow IAM to rotate their own credentials programmatically and in the console, Allow user to start and stop EC2 instances, etc...*

**Policy Example**
```json
{
	"Version" : "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [
		{
			"Effect": "Allow", 
			"Action": [
				"ec2: StartInstances",
				"ec2: StopInstances"
			],
			"Resource": "arn:aws:ec2:*:*:instance/*",
			"Condition": {
				"StringEquals": {
					"aws:ResourceTag/Owner": "${aws:username}" 
				}
			}
		},
		{
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Action": "ec2:DescribeInstances",
			"Resources": "*"
		}
	]
}
```

to finish up the section you should be able to create a normal users, group users, roles, Policies(and attach them)

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Two or more factors in order to authenticate (i.e, figure out who you are)

	- Something you know (e.g. , a password)
	- Something you have (e.g. , a phone or a hardware token)
	- Something you are (e.g. , fingerprint)

#### Three types of MFA Devices

	1. Virtual MFA device for smartphone or tablet (google, microsoft)
	2. U2F Security key (yubikey)
	3. Other hardware key ex:gamalto

*Best Practices is to enable MFA for your root account and IAM users*

#### What is an Access key ?
an access key is a way to have permessions into the console using your terminal but you two things

	1. Access key ID
	2. Secret Key (which you shouldn't have it in any code source)

### IAM Best Practices

	- Use an IAM user for day-to-day work, NOT the root account.
	- Use roles to give permissions to AWS services.
	- Don't share credentials.
	- Assign permissions to groups rather than individual users.
	- When assigning permissions, give the least amount possible.
	- Enforce MFA and strong password policies.
	- Use the IAM Credentials Report to audit permissions.

## Security and Compliance Services

- Infrastructure Protection
- Data Protection
- Detection
- Incident Response
- Compliance

### Infrastructure Protection :

#### What is a DDoS attack ? 
A DDoS attack is a cyber attack that overloads a website or service with too much traffic, making it unavailable. The attack originates from multiple sources to overwhelm the target. It is important for organizations to have proper security measures in place to protect against DDoS attacks.

#### 1. AWS Shield

- This is a service that AWS offer for protection against **DDoS**.
- Think of it as Shield that sets and protects the server from attacks.

- There is 2 types of AWS Shield:
	1. **STANDARD** :
		- Automatically protects all AWS customers.
		- Free
		- Protects from the most common types of **DDoS** attacks.

	2. **ADVANCED** : 
		- A paid service that protects against more sophisticated attacks and provides detailed diagnostics.
		- Integrates with other services like CloudFront, Route 53 and Elastic Load Balancing.
		- AWS Web Application Firewall (**WAF**) included at no extra cost.

#### 2. Web Applicatoin Firewall (WAF) :
- FireWall is a term refers to a physical wall between houses or structures that was meant to prevent the spread of fire.
- Same in technology, a Web Application Firewall also set in front of your web applications protecting it against common exploits and bots.

- **Configure rules** :
	1. Allow, block, monitor/count.
	2. IP addresses, country of origin, presence of a script, URL strings, etc...

### Data Protection

#### Two Types of Encryption

AT REST | IN TRANSIT
--- | ---
Data is stored or archived on a device | Data being transferred from one location to another
Examples : S3 bucket, Hard disk, Databse | Examples: Moving data from an EC2 instance to an S3 bucket, Moving data from an on-premises data center to AWS

#### Encryption Keys
	- Let's say you have a super secret msg that you want to send to somebody but you don't want anyone to be able to read it.
	- So you gonna run it through an encryption algorithm and crypt it into something different.

#### AWS Key Management System (KMS) :

	- Primary Service for encryption in AWS
	- AWS manages the encryption hardware software and keys for you
	- Integrated with many AWS services, including EBS, S3, Redshift, and CloudTrail (ex: I want to encrypt a document stored in a S3 bucket.)
	- FIPS 140-2 Compliance: Level 2 overall (3 in some areas)

#### AWS CloudHSM (*Hardware Security Module*)

	 - AWS provisions the hardware and you do everything else
		 - AWS cannot access your keys 
		 - AWS cannot recover your keys
	- Integrated with a limited number of other AWS services
	- FIPS 140-2 Compliance: Level 3 (considered more secure)


#### Types of Keys

AWS MANAGED | CUSTOMER MANAGED | CUSTOM KEY STORES
--- | --- | ---
AWS creates and manages | You (customer) create and manage | Created with CloudHSM
Used by AWS services (*aws/lambda, aws/cloud9, aws/s3*) | Can create policies | you own and manage
 __ | Specify who can use and manage the keys | __

---

#### AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)

- You use certificate to make sure that the connection between your request and the response that you receive is encrypted and safe.

- Certificate is just a text file that you put on your server and **Identifies the server as reputable** and also **Ensures communication between us is encrypted**.

- This is called **Transport Layer Security** (TLS) and it replaces the old certificate **Secure Sockets Layer** (SSL).

---

#### AWS Secrets Manager (Gives you the code snippet for your application.)

The recommended way to protect secrets (e.g., user names and passwords) needed by your applications and services.

Example: You created a application that has database on the backend and you need to access this database and it requires username and password.

	-  Hard-code the credentials
	-  Store credentials on the file system ad then retrieve them when you need it.
	-  Use AWS Secrets Manager

The first and Second option are not preferable cause the are not that secure. So we go to the usage of AWS Secrets Manager.

#### Amazon Macie

- It works specificaly with simple storage service S3 and Automatically inventories S3 buckets.
- Then Identifies and analyzes **PII** data using machine learning and pattern matching.
- **PII** (Personally Identifiable Information): this is information that if somebody knew it, they will be able to connect to you personally.
- Outputs finding which can integrate with **CloudWatch** and **EventBridge** to automate workflows and remediation.


---
### Detection

#### Amazon Inspector

	- This service is used to automate the monitoring and analyzing for security issues.
	- Automatically detects and scans your servers (**EC2 instances**) and your containers (**Elastic container repository**) for software vulnerabilities and network exposure.
	 - And then try to makes sense of the findings and assigns a risk score to each one.
	 - Integrates with **Security Hub** and **EventBridge** to automate workflows and ticketing.

#### Amazon GuardDuty

	- This is another method that you can automate some of the security work in AWS.
	- It is Continuously analyzes network, account and data access from your own private network (**CloudTrail Mgmt and S3 Events** - **VPC Flow and DNS Logs**).
	- Then using machine learning, identifies and prioritizes potential threats.
	- After that using a combination of **CloudWatch** and **Lambda** to automate workflows and remediation.

#### AWS Config
It's a service that effectively let you take an Inventory, record and audit the configuration of your various AWS resources.

Example :

	- Inventory all your **S3** buckets, and when one of them becomes publicly accessible, receive an alert.
	- Receive an alert when an unauthorized port opens on a security group(**Firewall**).
	- During a compliance audit, show when configurations changed.

---


#### AWS Security Hub
It's a service that Pulls everything together into a central consolidated place where you can view and take actions on security issues.

	- Requires AWS Config
	- Cross-account
	- Aggregates data from different services (GuardDuty, Inspector, Macie, IAM Access Analyzer, Systems Manager and Firewall Manager).

---

### Incident Response

#### Amazon Detective

- It 's actually work with your **GuardDuty Findings**, so you have to be running it in order to run Detective.
- It also looks at the **CloudTrail Logs** and **VPC Flow Logs**, these are essentially the logs that shows the traffic IN and OUT of your private network in AWS.
- Detective is used during incident response, some kind of a security breach incident, the team needs to quickly organize the data coming in make sense of it and then identifies the **Root Cause** quickly.
- Some of the others services that we talked about are basically scanning for vulnerabilities suspicious activity and Amazon Detective helps to get to the underline cause so you can eradicate the issue.

- Builds a linked set of data using machine learning, statistical analysis and graph theory.
- Using **Security Hub** and **GuardDuty** to Provides visualizations, context and detailed findings to help get to the root cause. 

#### AWS Artifact

- Your company probably has various regulation from industries and government and the country where you operate (Payment card industry, iso, etc...)

- Self-service portal to access AWSâ€™s internal compliance reports and agreements.

- Free.
