# Cloud Concepts (*26% of the exam*) :

### Any website you intend to construct need a number of distinct components.
1. **Compute**, think of these as servers or computers that are going to do the processing required to run your website.

2. **Database**, that's were you store information about products and customers , etc...

3. **Storage**, this is slightly difference from databases, here we are talking about storing somethings like pictures of products, or marketing documents for the different product that you are selling.

4. **Networking**, this is what allows your customers to connect to your website through the internet just like any other websites.

5. **Security**, meaning that the data about your customers, their payment information, their order information and so on. That it can't be hacked or stolen by infectious characters. 

**You are basicly going to replace all this with migrating into the cloud which makes all of this available for you and ready to use with a pay as you go pricing. How Cool is That ?**

### Foundational Services 
	1. Compute : Elastic Compute Cloud (**EC2**) .
	2. Database : Relational Database Service (**RDS**) and **DnamoDB** .
	3. Storage : Simple Storage Service (**S3**) . 
	4. Networking : Virtual Private Cloud (**VPC**) . 
	5. Security : Identity and Access Management (**IAM**) . 

### Benifits of the Cloud

Term | Description | Example
-- | -- | --
Elasticity | The ability to adapt to workload changes. | Amazon.com hanlding a hige spike in traffic on Prime Day.
Scalibility | The ability to handle increased workloads by adding resources. | Scale up a database because the size has grown over time.
High availability | The ability to continue functioning even if some components fail. | When a power outage causes on data center to go down, traffic is routed to another.
Reliability | The ability to function consistently and correctly when expected. | 99.99% uptime for EC2 instances during a given month.
Agility | The ability to rapidly develop, test, and launch applications to deliver business value. | Launch a new business application in days rather than months.
Global reach | The ability to get closer to your customers through a global infrastructure. | 25 Availability Zones around the world.
Pay-as-go pricing | Only pay for what you use, and only when you need it | An EC2 instance only used for 2 hours; only pay for 2 hours.
Economies of scale | Because of their size, AWS can purchase things more cheaply than an individual organization can | Amazon purchases servers at a fraction of the cost that you could, and pass the savings on to you.

### What is Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) ?
Its is basicly the sum of the **Up-front cost** (Capital Expnese: *CapEx*) and the **cost to operate** (Operating Expense *OpEx*).

With **AWS** you can get rid of the Capital Expenses totally cause **AWS Services** provide it for you but for the Operating Expenses you git rid of some of it but you pay much less on compared to building your own data center.

### Ways to Reduce Costs in AWS 
	- Right-sized infrastructure
	- Automation
	- Compliance scope
	- Managed Services

### What is the AWS Well-Architected Framework ?
The **AWS Well-Architected Framework** helps you understand the pros and cons of decisions you make while building systems on **AWS**. By using the Framework you will learn architectural best practices for designing and operating reliable, secure, efficient, and costeffective systems in the cloud.

You should get familiar with the pillars as they could be mentioned in the exam.

Name | Description
--- | ---
Operational Excellence | The ability to support development and run workloads effectively , gain insight into their operations, and continuously improve supporting process and procedures to deliver business value.
Security | The security pillar describes how to take advantage of cloud technologies to protect data, systems, and assets in a way that can improve your security posture.
Reliability | The reliability pillar encompasses the ability of a workload to perform its intended function correctly and consistenly when it's expected to. This includes the ability to operate and test the workload through its total lifecycle. This paper provides in-depth, best practice guidance for implementing reliable workloads on **AWS**.
Performance Efficiency | The ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements, and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve.
Cost Optimization | The ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point.
Sustainability | The ability to coninually improve sustainability impacts by reducing energy consumption and increasing efficiency across all components of a workload by maximizing the benifits from the provisioned resources and minimizing the total resources required.

### Getting back to the [Exam Guide](https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/docs-cloud-practitioner/AWS-Certified-Cloud-Practitioner_Exam-Guide.pdf)  you should really be familiar with the General Design Principals.

#### Cloud Architecture Design Principles 
	- Design for failure (*Everything fails all the time*).
	- Decouple components (*Different components of the system should work independently*).
	- Implement elasticity (*Scale up and down when needed*).
	- Think parallel (*Think about the workload*)

### Important Points to Remember

#### BENIFITS
	- Global reach: Data Centers around the world.
	- High availability: Continue functioning even when one component goes down.
	- Cost Savings: Reduces up-front costs and ongoing costs.
		- Only pay for what you use.
		- Right-sizing infrastructure means you don't have to "guess" capacity.
		- Managed services reduce your IT overhead/spend.

#### DESIGN PRINCIPLES
	 - Design for failure: assume things will fail, and architect for that.
	 - Loose coupling: reduces the dependencies between components.
	 - Elasticity: ability to scale resources up and down based on needs.
	 - Reliability: perform an intended function correctly and consistently when expected to.


### You should get a look at [Well-Architected Framework](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/welcome.html)
